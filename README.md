_Caveats_

Google requires the conference logo image to be hosted on Google Photos. I didn't find a good way to share access to this file, but I put it under my (max@hackclub.com) Photos account.

Assets are on the [Hack Club Team Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/1juGj8bzfH2d9aW9TUra1Y/Slash-Z?node-id=0%3A1)
