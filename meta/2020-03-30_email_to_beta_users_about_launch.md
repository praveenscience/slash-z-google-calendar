Subject: Beta users: Slash Z is out!

---

I'm reaching out because you're part of the Slash Z Calendar Add-on beta.

I've got news on Slash Z's official launch: Google reviewed the app and gave it **2 thumbs up**. _(actually their words were "We’ve completed our review and your item has been published")._ Now you can install the Calendar Add-on yourself & get nice things like automatic updates. I can't guarantee the beta version will continue working, so you should change over to the published version as soon as possible. **Changing over won't affect your existing calendar events & all the meetings you've created will still work.**

Because you installed with the beta, there are a couple extra steps before you can install it from the Google Add-on marketplace. 

1. Go to Google Calendar and go to the /z settings. (Don't see the "/z" icon? [Check the bottom right corner](https://cloud-lqynz01ry-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_shot_2021-03-29_at_17.58.13.png))

2. It'll open a Google Script page. Go click "Deploy" > "Test deployments". It might make you sign into your Google account, go ahead and do that. If you can't find the "deploy" button, make sure you are logged into the same Google account you installed it with.

3. **UNINSTALL**

4. Now you can sign up for the published add-on at https://hack.af/z-addon.

5. Go to calendar.google.com and you'll be able to create a new scheduling like just like before. Have an error that says "Try again"? Google Calendar is kinda dumb– refresh the page before creating a new event.

That's it! Thanks so much to everyone who tested this out & bearing with me as I got it to a stable point. If you run into any issues while going through these steps, please don't hesitate to reach out!
