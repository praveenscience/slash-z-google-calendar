Subject: Slash Z beta access

---

Hey there! I'm sending this email to show you how to get setup with the Slash Z beta b/c you asked for access either on Slack or in the all-hands call. As a quick reminder, this will let you create Zoom meetings (without the 40 minute deadline) straight from your calendar. The link also won't expire, so you can use the same call link for recurring calendar events.

1. Go to [this link](https://script.google.com/home/projects/14PfIgZFtzMCQ8pcOfSR-mzGi52IjcU_fKc645BUgrxq0mo7_m6W2Qc0x).
2. Click "make a copy"

3. Now go to the "editor" tab and click "run". Wait for it to load. It'll spit out some errors. Just ignore them.

4. (optional) It might ask for permissions to run. Go ahead and authorize it

7. Now go to calendar.google.com & create a new event. You should see a "Pro Zoom Meeting" when you click on the conference options

8. For this first meeting, you'll have to authorize with Google & log in with Slack. It should be pretty straight forward

9. From there you can 1-click create meetings in google calendar with **Slash Z**!

Let me know if you have any trouble getting it working. This is very much an ad-hoc solution to get it installed on your account & I've had a bunch of people say they had to slightly alter the steps. Thanks for bearing with me while I roll this out.
