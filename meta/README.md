This is the first time I've published something on Google, and it a bit
daunting. Google asked a bunch of questions about my app I didn't really know
the answer to. They asked for things like a privacy policy and TOS, which
I've never written before.

I tried searching the internet for things like "justification for external request google OAuth perms", but could find nothing. There's a total lack of reference or example on how to go through review.

The intent of this folder is to be the example I was looking for when I first
started this project.

It **won't** be a tutorial, or FAQ on how to get through the process. I'm
just dropping in documents I have related to the review / publishing / launch
of this project when I find them.
