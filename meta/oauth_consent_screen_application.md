# OAuth Consent Screen Application
This is the OAuth consent screen application. I had to submit & resubmit after feedback/rejection multiple times. Each of my responses had to change multiple timesâ€“ the responses below are the final responses used when the submission was accepted.

My first submission was on 2021-02-27, the final submission was accepted on 2021-03-26.
